Hello.  This is the README for BitDozer.  MicroSoft decided to screw over their Windows Phone Developers and ditch their technology stacks that
they made everyone use for developing these apps.  Case and point, you cannot even open a Windows Phone 7 project in VS2012.  You will need to use
VS2010 with the Windows Phone 7 SDK if you want to build this, and if you want to deploy it to your phone, you will need to make sure you are 
registered with MSFT and have your phone registered to allow deployments.  Even then, periodically Darth Softie will flip a switch and make your
phone dump the application because its not a purchased application, and you'll have to deploy it again.  

This is mainly being released to the The People of the World so that maybe someone somewhere will LEARN from it.  As of release, Bitdozer has
been downloaded and used by about/over 300 people.  Not too shabby for Windows Phones.  I've considered revising it and releasing it for Android as
well as fixing the now-broken mining related API calls (they broke after the 0.5.x version of Bitcoin), but I don't have an Android phone presently.

And in case you didn't actually read, you need version 0.5.x of Bitcoin for Bitdozer to work w/o error messages.  It can still be used with 0.8.x, 
but you will receive some annoying error messages that can be safely ignored as they are mining related.  Sending/receiving still works just fine.
Anyway, hope you all enjoy.  

In Your Service,
~ Gecko Fawkes
